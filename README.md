# Instagram_reach_analysis_learning1

This was a fun project, especially using wordcloud for the first time. 

Due to information sensitivity, the dataset used here is the one provided by Aman Kharwal in his blog(https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2022/03/22/instagram-reach-analysis-using-python/) which is stated to be used for educational purpose.

In the dataset which I downloaded, there were no missing or null values, and hence datacleaning was omitted.
Exploratory data analysis was perfomed using distribution curves, donut chart and as an additional method to the correlation method, I used heatmaps to compare and visualize.

XGBregressor and passive agressive regressor were used model and predict the reach.
